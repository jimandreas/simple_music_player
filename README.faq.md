# Music Player - Frequently Asked Questions

## Chromecast & Casting

### Q: Does this work with the Google TV Streamer (4K)?
**A:** Yes! The app works with all Cast-enabled devices including:
- Google TV Streamer (4K) - Google's latest streaming device
- Chromecast with Google TV
- Older Chromecast devices (Ultra, 3rd gen, etc.)
- Android TVs with built-in Chromecast (Sony, TCL, Hisense, etc.)
- Smart displays (Google Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max)

On devices with screens, you'll also see the track name and album art displayed while casting.

### Q: Do my phone and Chromecast need to be on the same WiFi network?
**A:** Yes, your Android device and Cast device must be connected to the same WiFi network for casting to work.

### Q: Can I control playback from my phone while casting?
**A:** Yes! All playback controls (play, pause, skip, previous, seek, volume) work while casting. The controls on your phone will affect the audio playing on your Cast device.

## Music Files & Folders

### Q: What audio formats are supported?
**A:** The app supports the following audio formats:
- MP3
- AAC / M4A
- FLAC
- OGG
- WAV
- WMA
- Opus

### Q: Can I play music from my SD card?
**A:** Yes! When you tap the folder icon, you can choose between internal storage and your SD card (if one is inserted).

### Q: Why do I need to select a folder instead of seeing all my music?
**A:** The app uses Android's Storage Access Framework for privacy and security. This means you choose which folders the app can access, giving you full control over your music library.

## Playback Features

### Q: How does shuffle work?
**A:** When shuffle is enabled, the app plays tracks in random order but ensures every track plays once before any track repeats. This gives you variety while making sure you hear all your music.

### Q: Does the app remember where I left off?
**A:** Yes! The app remembers:
- The last folder you selected
- The last track you were playing
- Your shuffle setting

When you reopen the app, it will restore your previous session.

### Q: Can I see album art?
**A:** Yes! If your audio files have embedded album art, it will be displayed in both the track list and the now-playing section. Files without embedded art will show a default music icon.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The Cast button doesn't appear. What's wrong?
**A:** The Cast button only appears when Cast-enabled devices are detected on your network. Check that:
- Your Cast device is powered on
- Both devices are on the same WiFi network
- Google Play Services is up to date on your phone

### Q: Music won't play on my Chromecast. What should I do?
**A:** Try these steps:
1. Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi network
2. Check that your Cast device isn't being used by another app
3. Disconnect and reconnect to the Cast device
4. Restart the app

### Q: The app takes a long time to load my music folder. Is this normal?
**A:** For folders with many files (hundreds or thousands), initial loading may take several seconds. You'll see an animated loading indicator while files are being scanned. Once loaded, navigation is fast.

### Q: Why can't I see my cloud storage music?
**A:** The app is designed for locally stored music files. Cloud-synced folders (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) may not work reliably due to how Android handles cloud storage access.
